For my undergraduate senior design course, my team and I are working on a redesign of a “Miniature Plant Growth Chamber.” Plants will be grown hydroponically in a rectangular grow box, with support for CO2 and O2 sensing, temperature and humidity control, lighting, automatic irrigation, and imaging. The complete system is to be easily expandable to chain 16 growth chambers into a network.

The 16 grow chambers are to be of two kinds: heating and cooling, to accommodate for a greater variety of plants. Heating and cooling is accomplished by controlling the thermoelectric capacitors. This project builds on functionality from the previous design by adding the capability of two kinds of grow chambers, as well as a redesign of the grow chamber design, as well as its central control box. Our group is also adding a ventilation system, more sensors, better humidity management, fan speed control, and light timing ability.

This project involves many important engineering components and skills. Analog and digital electronics skills are utilized through circuit design and Arduino programming. Mechanical knowledge also went into the design for plant and fan placement for optimum air ventilation. Ultimately, the goal of improving and advancing the previous groups design is to improve reproducibility through a modular growth chamber.

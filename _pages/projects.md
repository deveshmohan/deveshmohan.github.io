### ASABE Robotics Competition | May 2017 – July 2017
Over the upcoming summer, I will be preparing for the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) robotic challenge, where robots will be required to operate over a simulated sugarcane field. 3 robots will need to autonomously navigate the course through color-based object detection, using a cutting mechanism to remove certain weak and strong canes. Stayed tuned for blog posts documenting my progress.

### Sustainable Engineering Economic Study | Nov 2016 - Present
I am currently working on a self-designed solution for food production shortages. My feasibility study is titled, “Addressing world food shortage through vertical farming and efficient microgrid design,” and aims to tackle the problems of food shortages and high food prices in regions that are either incapable of producing food, or, where the cost of produce can be lowered. In these regions, import costs of transportation are the main cause for high food prices. Vertical farms can be used to produce food in local areas, utilizing local renewable energy capabilities (eg. wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal) and an efficient microgrid design. This study aims to determine if we can offset the high operating costs of vertical farms through renewably generated electricity to power the farm. The outcome will determine whether the cost of the farm grown produce can be sold competitively, with the hope to reduce food costs and provide year-round availability.

I will be supporting this study at the following conferences:
Mascaro Center for Sustainable Engineering Conference - NSF Grant supported attendee - April 10-11, 2017
National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) - Poster presentation - April 6-8, 2017

## University Project Work

### Fatty Acid Detection through Label-free Biosensing  (LIOS) | Aug 2015 – May 2016
Under Dr. Meng Lu at the Laboratory of Integrated Optical Sensors (LIOS), I worked to develop an optical label-free biosensing system for fatty acid detection/analysis based on plasmonic crystals. I prepared around 40 flow cells over my time, getting used to the delicate procedures of the fabrication. The acrylic cells required precise .75mm drilling and tubing to prevent fluid leakages. Using a lab-developed nanoreplica molding technique, gold coated plasmonic sensor were bonded onto a glass plate and to the fuel cell using UV crosslinkers. The goal was to create a delicate enough cell to pass light onto the plasmonic sensor while the flow cell was running a solution of fatty acid. Data analysis of the surface plasmon resonance was compared to predicted values, to benchmark flow cell build procedure. The intended result to be used by pharmaceutical companies for targeted drug delivery and development. The key here was repetition and hand dexterity.

### LASER Electrical Engineering Team Member | Sept 2014 – May 2015
As a member of the Aerospace Engineering student research department, I worked in a sub-team of 3 EE’s on the LASER (Light Aircraft Solar Extended Range) Team. Our goal was to beat our air class’ flight record for planes using solar energy. We always ran into issues with the FAA regarding when and where we could test out planes, so sadly I never got to see it in action. I worked on the Laser 4 plane, specifically on battery optimization, where I tested connected circuitry and ran battery simulations for charging and discharging times. I also worked on the poorly designed Ardupilot aviation system to gather data from the planes sensors. This worked semi-successfully, but we never got to test it.

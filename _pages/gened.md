## General Education Reflection

My current short term goals are to attend graduate school in Electrical Engineering. Using my skills in Integrated Circuits, my long term goal is to achieve a career in robotics and automation.

My general education electives in biology helped me conduct research in the LIOS Lab under Dr Meng Lu. In this class I learned about algae blooms, which was directly related to my research on microcystin detection in freshwater algae blooms. Similarly, my electives in Russian Politics and Chinese Culture helped me interact with students of various nationalities during my summer internship at Grenoble, France.

Further, my ability to see problems from various perspectives (cultural, economic, scientific) helped extensively during my participation in the Disney Imagination Contest 2018, where I entered a project proposal for building a new ag research-focused city in Iowa. This included economic analysis learned from IE 305 (Economics for Engineers), crop production in Iowa from Biology 211 (Biology Basics), and simply the exposure to the agricultural industry in Iowa.


## Cumulative Reflection

Attending ISU has been a tremendous experience. I have learned an incredible amount simply by being near the huge agricultural industry that Iowa supports. I have participated in many agriculture-related projects and job opportunities, something I would never had the chance to anywhere else.

The engineering education I received here was widely respected by employers, and I was able to take that to Boeing in California, where I used knowledge from my Computer Science classes, as well as Electrical lab experience for many battery tests that I helped conduct.

The access to mechanical labs was vital for my senior design labs helped me learn basic mechanical processes, which I then used to learn robotics principles, ensuring a life-long ability to learn.

My general education classes introduced me to complex Russian politics and Chinese culture, giving me a global education. I am grateful for all these experiences.

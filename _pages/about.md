Hi, I am Devesh Mohan, an Electrical Engineering senior at Iowa State University. This is my personal page, glad you found it! If you think you saw me at an event, check the calendar below. Feel free to get in touch with me via email or Twitter (I need more followers). And stay tuned for an upcoming blog!

In my 4 years at Iowa State, I have participated in a great deal of projects, and had the privilege to work with some great mentors. Linked above are selections from research positions, internships, self-started projects, and classes. You may find more information on my LinkedIn or resume.

I was born in New York, but lived in New Delhi, India for many years and completed my higher education there. Perhaps this gave me an interest in traveling, and during my studies at Iowa State, I attended a Nanotechnology Summer School in Grenoble, France. Below is a picture on top of the Grenoble Bastille.

### Career Objectives

My goals for the future are to attend graduate school. I am very interested in robotics and automation (relevant projects are mentioned on the projects page). With my background in Integrated Circuits, I look forward to bringing those skills to circuit design companies.

You may find my resume here:

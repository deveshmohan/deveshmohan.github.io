## Industry Experience

### The Boeing Company, Huntington Beach, CA | Summer 2014
**IT Intern – Systems Engineering / Project Management**

IT internship as member of the Network Segmentation team responsible for improving the security, responsiveness, and capability of the Boeing global network. I created and reviewed engineering specification documents to be used in data centers, and worked in the groups RIO (Risk, Issue, and Opportunity) division. I was given the opportunity to travel to Seattle with the team for 2 days, where I toured the data centers and saw the very stacks where my installation document would be used. For the RIO team, I helped transition all data onto an online database, as well as moderated the monthly board meeting. As side projects during my time, I facilitated a team of interns for the Wearable Computing Technology Group, develop proof-of-concept technologies for an airline crash site.

## Research Internship

### Laboratory of Integrated Optical Sensors (LIOS), Iowa State Univ, IA | Summer 2016
Sole-investigator for project under Dr. Meng Lu titled, “Water Quality Study for Microcystin Detection using Colorimetric Gold Nanoparticles,” to detect the presence of Microcystin-LR toxin in drinking water. Cyanobacteria is found to produce blooms in water sources, releasing toxic microcystin in drinking water supplies. The group aims to produce a cheap biosensor with color based assessment of water quality, for quick, cheap and portable detection. Much of my work involved testing precise concentrations (um order) of aptamer against gold nanoparticles and microcystin. This involved repeated meticulous testing, and patience.

I am presenting this research at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) 2017, Memphis as an Oral Presentation

### GIANT Internship at Laboratory in Materials Science and Physical Engineering (LMGP), Grenoble, France | Summer 2015
Research internship under Dr. Celine Ternon titled, “DNA Grafting on Nanowires,” to quantify the amount of DNA deposited on Si/ZnO nanowires and perfect procedure to improve reproducibility. This internship exposed me to biotechnology and materials engineering processes like spectroscopy and grafting techniques. My main role was data analysis and making cool graphs for the team. The intended result was a biosensor device for disease detection.

I presented this research at the ISU Undergraduate Research Symposium 2016 as an Oral Presentation

1) A code of ethics is very important. It can save you or your company from being sued and losing large amounts of money, power, respect, or a combination of them. Many companies have their own code of ethics, and the IEEE code of ethics outlines many of these guidelines to be able to operate professionally within personal and professional guidelines. However, I find a personal code of ethics to be more valuable. This line from the 5 P’s document outlines it best: “A true ethical code … is an unspoken arrangement that loses its moral foundation as soon as someone tries to turn it into a set of laws”

2) Ethics are important, they define us and the decisions we make. Cheating is a common situation observable in an academic situation. Many group projects for EE classes are group-based collaborative projects often carried forward from past years. It is very likely that some students have borrowed large elements from past years, however it is not ethical to do so. This is where there is a conflict in a code of ethics between IEEE and a personal code of ethics. If I observe a fellow student cheating on an assignment, IEEE code of ethics 1, 2, and 3 are violated by plagiarizing past work. However, a personal code of ethics is more important in my opinion. I would not report such a crime in an academic situation (a professional environment is a different case), and snitching is not the right path to take. One learns from their mistakes, and copying will never make you feel like you made a mistake, and you will never learn. Repercussions must be faced personally, and I will not be the one to throw this water in their face.

3) I did not attend the group meeting and attended the makeup. I have discussed a situation above in detail. I can easily expect others to have entirely divergent opinions on the same situation above with valid reason, but I do believe in the line mentioned in answer 1) from the 5 P’s document: “A true ethical code … is an unspoken arrangement that loses its moral foundation as soon as someone tries to turn it into a set of laws.”

4)   In the case above with regards to cheating in group project assignments, the 3 virtues I would choose are: 1. Integrity, 2. Honesty, 3. Responsibility


Integrity is the most important, as at the end of the day one’s integrity defines the decisions we make in situations, and in the case of cheating, while the group members cheating may not have integrity, my self-integrity is very important to not destroy a fellow student’s life as you may never know what situations have forced them to follow such a path, and I am not one to judge. Again, in a job and a professional environment, it is not just him, but the entire company and by extension my job is on the line, and so I would definitely report such behavior. But college is when one figures themselves out. I have figured out I am not a snitch.

Honesty closely ties into this, and those cheating are not just being dishonest to the school, but to themselves about their own abilities.

This is where responsibility comes in. Is it my responsibility to report such behavior? This is debatable, and the answer will likely vary person-to-person.

The other virtues of fidelity, charity, and self-discipline are not immediately applicable. Fidelity, or faithfulness, is more applicable to those engaging in activity of cheating, while charity is perhaps from those who passed on the work to those cheating. Self-discipline is more applicable as it is what I am exhibiting, by showing restraint.
